# Bank_Loan_Analysis
Bank Loan Analysis is the process a bank uses to check if a customer can repay a loan. The bank examines the customer’s income, credit history, existing debts, and collateral. Based on this information, the bank decides whether to approve the loan and what interest rate to offer.
